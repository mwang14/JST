# Dataset Generation and Usage
---
In this folder, we provide several scripts to facilitate the usage of JST. The scripts are as follows:

- [__beautify_and_update_data.py__](beautify_and_update_data.py): The code that is on the internet is typically [minified](https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/minification/). The scripts downloaded by default are often in a single line. Luckily, there are beautifiers out there which can reverse some of this process by separating minified scripts into multiple lines and adding indentation.
